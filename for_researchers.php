 				<p><strong>Task Mart</strong> is a generic platform for recruiting participants for any type of (mostly academic) studies. While in most cases you will want to develop a study and deploy it somewhere online and integrate it following <a href="#">this guide</a>, <strong>Task Mart</strong> can also be simply used to find participants for simple questionnaires hosted in Google Forms, Webropol, etc. Again, refer to our integration guide to see how to reward participants in such a case. </p>

		        We get a bit more than a thousand participants a day on <strong>Task Mart</strong> on average (this number only includes those participants who have finished the whole length of an experiment ). However, the number of participants fluctuates highly depending on the availability of experiments, their popularity, and probably many other factors that we do not have control over.
